# MiniMapLine Add-On

 World of Warcraft's minimap add-ons are great for showing you treasures, rares, and other custom icons; but all that content can make it hard to see which direction your character is pointing. With MiniMapLine, a line is added to to your minimap pointing in your current direction. You can customize the width of the line to make it as subtle or chonky as you desire.

## Usage
1. Install the MiniMapLine add-on using CurseForge, WowUp, or any other add-on manager.
2. Use the default thickness (2px) or customize it in Options by using the `/mml` command.
3. If you're using a square minimap shape, select Square in the `/mml` options to have MiniMapLine adapt its length to the edge of your minimap.

<strong>Note</strong>: The line cannot be shown when in a restricted zone (instance, battle ground, arena) as [the API used does not work there](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/API_GetPlayerFacing).
