# MiniMapLine Add-On

 World of Warcraft's minimap add-ons are great for showing you treasures, rares, and other custom icons; but all that content can make it hard to see which direction your character is pointing. With MiniMapLine, a line is added to to your minimap pointing in your current direction. You can customize the width of the line to make it as subtle or chonky as you desire.

## Usage
1. Install the Iconer add-on using CurseForge, WowUp, or any other add-on manager.
2. Use the default thickness (2px) or customize it in Options by using the `/mml` command.
